Instructions:

Place ServerConstruction.lua code inside a Modulescript somewhere (I prefer in a modules folder in ServerStorage)
Create a RemoteEvent, and place it somewhere.
Create a script with RunContext "Client", and place it inside the RemoteEvent.

Congratulations, you've got a module that tweens a model from the bottom-up!
